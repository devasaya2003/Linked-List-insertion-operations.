## Linked-List-insertion-operations.  
#There are 4 types of insertion operations we can perform on a linked list.  
#These operations are as follows:  
1. Insertion at the beginning -> Inserting an element at the beginning of the linked list.  
2. Insertion in between -> Inserting an element at or after a particular index.  
3. Insertion at the end -> Inserting an element at the end of the linked list.  
4. Insertion after a given node -> Inserting an element after a given node in a linked list.  
  
#Time complexities:  
1. Insertion at the beginning -> O(1)  
2. Insertion in between -> O(n)  
3. Insertion at the end -> O(n)  
4. Insertion after a given node -> O(1)
